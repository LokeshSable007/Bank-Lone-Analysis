## Bank Lone Analysis
Hello Everyone!

I am so excited to share my latest Excel Dashboard on Bank Lone Analysis!

The primary objective of this dataset is to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.

I have used KPIs like Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI).

Other than that In order to evaluate the performance of our lending activities and assess the quality of our loan portfolio, we need to create a comprehensive Dashboard that distinguishes between 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans' based on specific loan status criteria.

I have visually represented critical loan-related metrics and trends using a variety of chart types. These charts will provide a clear and insightful view of our lending operations, facilitating data-driven decision-making and enabling us to gain valuable insights into various loan parameters.
